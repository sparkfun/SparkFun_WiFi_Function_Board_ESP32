The SparkFun MicroMod ESP32 Function Board adds additional wireless options to MicroMod Processor Boards that do not have that capability. This special function board acts as a coprocessor that takes advantage of Espressif's ESP32 WROOM to add WiFi and Bluetooth&reg; to your applications. 

At the core of the ESP32 WROOM module is the ESP32-D0WD-V3 chip which is designed to be both scalable and adaptive. ESP32 WROOM module on this board  features 16MB of flash memory, 520kB of internal SRAM, an integrated 802.11 b/g/n WiFi transceiver, and dual-mode Bluetooth capabilities. Utilizing our handy M.2 MicroMod connector, no soldering is required to connect it to your system. Simply match up the key on your processor and function board's beveled edge connector to their respective key on the M.2 connector, then secure them to the main board with screws. The ESP32 WROOM module can then be controlled using AT commands via the serial UART port.

The ESP32 Function Board comes pre-flashed with AT-command firmware and acts as a serial-to-WiFi gateway. Next to the module is a USB-C connector and CP2102 USB-to-serial converter. Whether you want to add AT commands of your own, or flash custom firmware on the ESP32, you can use this port to reprogram the ESP32.
